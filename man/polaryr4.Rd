Question 2007-2008 has been designated the International Polar Year. During this year, many scientific and educational organizations will be making efforts to increase public awareness of the Earthâ€™s polar regions. These organizations hope that people will learn more about the people and animals that live near the poles, the changes taking place in the environment there, and new scientific discoveries about the Arctic and the Antarctic. Still looking at Card B22, do you think you would be very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely toâ€¦
D. Go to a museum to see an exhibit about the polar regions?
