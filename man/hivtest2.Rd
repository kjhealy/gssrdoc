\details{
Question Have you ever been tested for HIV? Do not count tests you may have had as part of a blood donation. Include oral test (where they take a swab from your mouth). B. Where did you have your last HIV test â€“ at a private doctor or HMO office, at a counselling and testing site, at a hospital, at a clinic, in a jail or prison, at home, or somewhere else?
As of 2024, HIVTEST2 has been recoded to only account for seven categories by combining jail, home, and drug treatment facility into "Somewhere else." This has been retroactively applied to all previous years of HIVTEST2. The original HIVTEST2 containing data from 2006 to 2022 has been renamed HIVTEST2_0622.
