\details{
Question Now I'm going to read a list of different feelings that people sometimes have. After each one, I would like you to tell me on how many days you have felt this way during the past 7 days. On how many days in the past 7 days have you... (SPECIFY NUMBER OF DAYS)
(IF RESPONDENT ASKS, SAY THAT FEELING THIS WAY AT ANY TIME DURING A DAY MAKES THAT DAY "COUNT.")
I. Felt fearful about something that might happen to you?
