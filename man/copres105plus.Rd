\details{
Question COPRES105PLUS is based on the 2010 Census occupation classification. This prestige score is calculated using an alternative method, based on the percentage of ratings that is greater than or equal to a threshold (rating five). The effect of individual raters is also removed using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).
