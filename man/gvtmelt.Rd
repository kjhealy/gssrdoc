Question Some people say that it is better for America if different racial and ethnic groups maintain their distinct cultures. Others say that it is better if groups change so that they blend into the larger society as in the idea of a melting pot. Here is a card with a scale from 1 to 7. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that racial and ethnic groups should maintain their distinct cultures, and a score of 7 as meaning that groups should change so that they blend into the larger society. What score between 1 and 7 comes closest to the way you feel? (CIRCLE ONE):
B. Should it be up to the government to help racial and ethnic groups change so that they blend into the larger society, or should this be left up to the groups themselves?
