Question The next few questions are about the Arctic and the Antarctic. The Arctic is the region around the North Pole; Antarctic is the region that contains the South Pole. These questions are like ones you might see on a television game show. If you donâ€™t know or arenâ€™t sure, just tell me so, and we will skip to the next question. Remember true, false, or donâ€™t know.
E. Would you say the polar ice caps have gotten larger or smaller over the last 25 years?
