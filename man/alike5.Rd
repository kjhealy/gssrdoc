Question Now I'd like to turn to something a bit different. This section is about reasoning abilities, that is, about how people think. Most people take tests of their reasoning abilities and there is a lot of interest in how these abilities may change over time. What I'd like you to do is tell me how two things are alike.
E. In what way are a table and a chair alike?
