\details{
Question In the first part of this questionnaire, we would like to ask you about your family and friends. For example, about how often you see or visit them, and when you turn to them for help or advice.
We would like to begin with your brothers and sisters. How many adult brothers and/or sisters - we mean brothers or sisters who are age 18 and older - do you have? (We mean brothers and sisters who are still alive. Please include step-brothers and -sisters, half-brothers and sisters and adopted brothers and sisters)
If you have no ADULT brothers or sisters, enter ''0''.
