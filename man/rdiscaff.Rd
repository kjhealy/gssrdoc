\details{
Question A. What do you think the chances are these days that you or anyone in your family won't get a job or promotion while an equally or less qualified (White/(Black/African-American)) employee receives one instead?  Would you say the chances of this happening are very likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely?
