Question What do you think the chances are these days that a white person won't get a job or promotion while an equally or less qualified black person gets one instead?  Is this very likely, somewhat likely, or not very likely to happen these days?
A. Do you feel this way because of something that happened to you personally, because it happened to a relative, family member or close friend, because you saw it occurring at work, or because you have heard about it from the media or other sources? (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY)
4. Heard about it on the media
