Question And one last question. We all know that American citizens have certain rights. For example, they have the right to free public education and to police protection, the right to attend religious services of their choice, and the right to elec public officials. I'd like to ask now about certain obligations that some people feel American citizens owe their country. I just want your own opinion on these--whether you feel it is a very important obligation, a somewhat important obligation, or not an obligation that a citizen owes to the country. (READ EACH STATEMENT AND CIRCLE ONE CODE for each).
(REPEAT ANSWER CATEGORIES AS NECESSARY)
B. How about volunteering some time to community services?
