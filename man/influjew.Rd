\details{
Question Some people think that certain groups have too much influence in American life and politics, while other people feel that certain groups don't have as much influence as they deserve. On this card are three statements about how much influence a group might have. (1. Too much influence, 2. Just about the right amount of influence, 3. Too little influence) For each group I read to you, just tell  me the number of the statement that best says how you feel.
B. Jews
