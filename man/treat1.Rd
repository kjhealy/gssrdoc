Question Next, I'm going to read you some descriptions of health problems people sometimes experience. Some people might go to a doctor, others might not.
A. The first description is: not being able to do moderate activities, such as moving a table, pushing a vacuum cleaner, bowling or playing golf? How likely would you be to seek medical treatment"that is, see a doctor, a nurse or other health professional"for this situation?  Would you definitely go probably go, probably not go, or definitely not go?
