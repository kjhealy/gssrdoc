Question Let's turn away from (NAME) now. I have a few questions about your general experiences that I would like to ask you. Leaving yourself aside, have you personally ever known someone who has received treatment for a mental health situation?
A. I want you to think about the person with a mental health problem with whom you have had the most contact, would you say you were extremely close, very close, not very close, or not at all close to that person?
