Question People have different ideas about the best way for women to improve their position in American life and politics. Some people think that the best way for women to improve their position is through women's rights groups, they would be at point 1 on this card. Other people think that the best way for women to improve their position is for each individual women to become better trained and more qualified. They would be located at point 7. And other people have opinions somewhere in between. Where would you place yourself on this scale?
