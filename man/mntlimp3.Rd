Question Of course, everybody hears a good deal about physical illness and disease, but now, what about the ones we call mental or nervous illness?...When you hear someone say that a person is "mentally-ill," what does that mean to you? (PROBES: How would you describe a person who is mentally-ill?  What do you think a mentally-ill person is like?  What does a person like this do that tells you he is mentally-ill?  How does a person like this act?)
3. R's imputed references for what mental illness is -- Third mention.
