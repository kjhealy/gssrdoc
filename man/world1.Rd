Question People have different images of the world and human nature. We'd like to know the kinds of images you have. Here is a card with sets of contrasting images. On a scale of 1-7 where would you place your image of the world  and human nature between the two contrasting images? (HAND CARD AH)
Look at the first set of contrasting images. If you think that "The world is basically filled with evil and sin," you would place yourself at 1. If you think "There is much goodness in the world which hints at God's goodness" you would place yourself at 7. If you think things are somewhere between these two you would place yourself at 2, 3,4, 5 or 6. (REPEAT EXAMPLE AS NECESSARY FOR EACH ITEM A-F) Where would you place your image of the world on the scale for . . .?
(READ EACH SET AND CIRCLE ONE CODE FOR EACH)
