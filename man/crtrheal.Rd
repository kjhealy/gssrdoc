Question There are many different ways of picturing God. We'd like to know the kinds of images you are most likely to associate with God. Here is a card with sets of contrasting images. On a scale of 1-7 where would you place your image of God between the two contrasting images? (HAND CARD AE) The first set of contrasting images shows Mother at 1 on the scale and Father at 7. If you imagine God as a Mother you would place yourself at 1. If you imagine God as a Father, you would place yourself at 7. If you imagine God as somewhere between Mother and Father, you would place yourself at 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. (REPEAT EXAMPLE AS NECESSARY FOR EACH ITEM A-F, SUBSTITUTING IMAGES A-F FOR "MOTHER" AND "FATHER".) Where would you place your image of God on the scale for . . . READ EACH SET OF IMAGES AND CIRCLE ONE CODE FOR EACH.
