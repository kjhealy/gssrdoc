Question On these cards are various aspects of life. We would like to know how important each of these aspects of life is for you. On each of these Cards you see on the right hand side a scale with seven points. The lowest point with number 1 indicates that this aspect of life is unimportant to you. Point 7 at the top indicates that particular aspect of life is very important to you.
The numbers in between indicate varying degrees of importance. Please take a look at all the cards first. Then, tell me for each card its letter and the number you've decided on. SHUFFLE THE SET OF BLUE CardS BEFORE HANDING TO RESPONDENT.
