Question The first issue is global warming. Global warming means a trend toward warmer temperatures throughoutthe world, with more extreme weather in many places and changes in food production that could affect our way of life. Some people believe that the burning of gasoline and other fossil fuels causes global warming. Others say that global warming has purely natural causes. Please look at Card B2. On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means â€œVery Wellâ€ and 5 means â€œNot at Allâ€, how well do the following groups understand the causes of global warming?
A. Environmental Scientists
