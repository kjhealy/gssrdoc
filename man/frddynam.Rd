Question I'm going to read seven qualities one might look for in a personal friend. All of the qualities may be desirable ones for a personal friend, but I'm interested in those that are most important to you. (HAND CARD CB TO RESPONDENT.)
As I read each one, could you tell me whether it is extremely important, very important, fairly important
ot too important, or not at all important.
C. Dynamic.
