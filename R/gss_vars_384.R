#'  daynight
#' 
#' Question Please look at Card I-3. Day-night rhythms dramatically affect our bodies. Probably no body system is more  influenced than the nervous system. The figure on Card I-3 illustrates the number of errors made by shift workers in different portions of the 24-hour cycle. Based on the data illustrated in the figure, during which of these time periods did the most errors occur?

#'  How well elected official know risk by nuclear power
#' 
#'  polnuke
#' 
#' Question Hereâ€™s another public issue: nuclear power. Nuclear power uses the energy of the atom to generate electricity. some people say that nuclear power is a safe option to meet the energy needs of the United States without burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, or natural gas. Others are concerned about potential risks in the operation of nuclear plants and about the disposal of nuclear waste. Please look at Card E13. (On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means "Very Well" and 5 means  Not At All), how well do the following groups understand the likely effects of using nuclear power to generate electricity?
#' A. Elected officials (How well elected officials know risk by nuclear power?)
