#'  Should employers give genetic tests
#' 
#'  genejob
#' 
#' Question Here are some questions about a new scientific technology called "genetic screening."  Using genetic screening, it is now possible to tell whether someone has inherited a tendency to develop certain cancers and certain forms of heart disease. These tests do not mean that a person will always develop the disease, but only that he or she may do so, depending on other conditions. 
#' A. Should employers have the right to give these genetic tests to people who are applying for a job, or shouldn't they have that right?
