#'  First mention of problem
#' 
#'  probfix1
#' 
#' Question Problems often come up in life. Sometimes they're personal problems -- people are very unhappy, or nervous and irritable all the time. Sometimes there are problems in a marriage -- a husband and wife just can't get along with each other. Or, sometimes it's a personal problem with a child or a job. I'd like to ask you a few questions now about what you think a person might do to handle problems like this. For instance, let's suppose you had a lot of personal problems and you're very unhappy all the time. Let's suppose you've been that way for a long time, and it isn't getting any better. What do you think you'd Do about it?
