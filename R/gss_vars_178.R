#'  fairhwrk
#' 
#' Question We're interested in knowing how much of the work around your home is done by different people. We don't mean taking care of children - just regular work around the house, like cooking, grocery shopping and doing little repair jobs. 
#' C. How fair do you feel the division of work around the house is in your household? Would you say that it is fair to both you and your spouse or partner, unfair to you, or unfair to your spouse or partner?
