#' Question There are many different ways of picturing God. We'd like to know the kinds of images you are most likely to associate with God. Here is a card with sets of contrasting images. On a scale of 1-7 where would you place your image of God between the two contrasting images? (HAND CARD AE) The first set of contrasting images shows Mother at 1 on the scale and Father at 7. If you imagine God as a Mother you would place yourself at 1. If you imagine God as a Father, you would place yourself at 7. If you imagine God as somewhere between Mother and Father, you would place yourself at 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
