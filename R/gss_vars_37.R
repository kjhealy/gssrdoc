#' Question A. People picture life after death in many different ways. We'd like to know how you think of life after death. Here is a card with sets of contrasting images. On a scale of 1-7 where would you place your image of life after death. Look at the first set of contrasting images. If you think that life after death is "A life like the one here on earth only better," you would place yourself at 1. If you think it is "A life without many things which make our present life enjoyable" you would place yourself at 7. If you think it is somewhere between these two you would place yourself at 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Where would you place your images of life after death for . . .?
