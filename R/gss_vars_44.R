#' Question I'd like to get your feelings toward groups that are in the news these days. I will use something we call the feeling thermometer, and here is how it works: I'll read the names of a group and I'd like you to rate that group using the feeling thermometer. Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel favorable and warm toward the group. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel favorable toward the group and that you don't care too much for that group. If we come to a group whose name you Don't recognize, you don't need to rate that group. Just tell me and we'll move on to the next one. IF you do recognize the name, but you don't feel particularly warm or cold toward the group, you would rate the group at the 50 degree mark. How would you rate this group using the thermometer?
