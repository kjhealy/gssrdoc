#' Question Before 2006 the GSS was only administered in English. Those without enough English to do the interview were excluded as out-of-scope, language problems. In 2006 a Spanish version of the GSS was added. If there had been no Spanish version available in 2006, could this respondent have been interviewed in English or do you think (s/he) would have been excluded as a language problem?
