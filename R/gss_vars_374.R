#' 
#' Question The first issue is federal income taxes. Some people say that reducing income taxes almost always helps the economy grow. Others say that reducing income taxes has very little long-term impact on economic growth but could cause a big increase in the deficit. Please look at Card B10. (On a scale of 1 to 5, where  1 means â€œVery Wellâ€ and 5 means â€œNot at Allâ€), how well do the following groups understand the likely effects of reducing federal income taxes?
#' C. Elected Officials

#'  How well med researcher know risk by genetically modified foods

#'  gmmed
#' 
#' Question Here is another public issue: genetically modified foods. Genetically modified foods come from plants or animals whose characteristics have been changed by the alteration, addition, or deletion of DNA in their genetic material using advanced laboratory techniques. Some say that genetically modified foods are unsafe and pose risks for human health. Others say that they are safe and necessary to reduce world hunger. Please look at Card B15. (On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means â€œVery Wellâ€ and 5 means â€œNot at Allâ€), how well do the following groups understand the risks posed by genetically modified foods? INSTRUCTION: IF ASKED WHAT â€œADVANCED LABORATORY TECHNIQUESâ€ MEANS: This typically involves â€œrecombinant DNAâ€ or â€œgene splicing,â€ in which genetic material from one organism is inserted into the genes of another. Sometimes, the two organisms are members of different species.
