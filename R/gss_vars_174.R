#'  Should ethnic congressmen represent ethnic groups
#' 
#'  congeth
#' 
#' Question Some people say that it is only fair that in a society like ours, people holding public office should have roughly the same racial or ethnic background as the population as a whole. So, for example, if 30pct of the people were Hispanic, then 30pct of the public officials should be Hispanic as well. Others say that in choosing people for public office they should be considered purely on the basis of ability without regard to their ethnic or racial background. Let me ask you about these ideas in several different areas.
