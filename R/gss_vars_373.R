#'  How well economist knows effect of reducing fed income tax

#' Question The first issue is federal income taxes. Some people say that reducing income taxes almost always helps the economy grow. Others say that reducing income taxes has very little long-term impact on economic growth but could cause a big increase in the deficit. Please look at Card B10. (On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means â€œVery Wellâ€ and 5 means â€œNot at Allâ€), how well do the following groups understand the likely effects of reducing federal income taxes?

Others say that reducing income taxes has very little long-term impact on economic growth but could cause a big increase in the deficit. Please look at Card B10. (On a scale of 1 to 5, where  1 means â€œVery Wellâ€ and 5 means â€œNot at Allâ€), how well do the following groups understand the likely effects of reducing federal income taxes?
